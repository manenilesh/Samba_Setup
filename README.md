Setting Up a Samba Share on Ubuntu

This README outlines the steps to set up a Samba server on Ubuntu, allowing you to share directories with other operating systems on your network.
1. Update and Install Samba

First, update your package lists and install the Samba server:
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba

2. Create Your Share Directory

Create the directory you want to share. This example uses /home/itadmin/share, but you can choose any location.
Bash

mkdir share
cd share
pwd # Verify your current directory

Alternatively, if you prefer a different location for your Samba shares, you can use:
Bash

sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/share

3. Configure Samba

Edit the Samba configuration file to define your share.
Bash

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Scroll to the very bottom of the file and add the following configuration block. If you used /srv/samba/share, adjust the path accordingly.
Ini, TOML

[share]
comment = Samba_server
path = /home/itadmin/share  # Or /srv/samba/share
read only = no
browsable = yes
writable = yes # Recommended for full read/write access
create mask = 0775 # Sets permissions for new files
directory mask = 0775 # Sets permissions for new directories
valid users = itadmin # Restrict access to specific users (optional)

Explanation of parameters:

    comment: A descriptive name for your share.
    path: The absolute path to the directory you want to share.
    read only: Set to no to allow write access.
    browsable: Set to yes to make the share visible when Browse the network.
    writable: Explicitly allows users to write to the share.
    create mask and directory mask: Define default permissions for new files and directories created within the share.
    valid users: (Optional) Restricts access to specific users. Replace itadmin with your desired username(s).

4. Set Permissions for the Share Directory (if using /srv/samba/share)

If you created your share in /srv/samba/share, you'll need to set appropriate permissions and ownership:
Bash

sudo chmod -R 0775 /srv/samba/share/
sudo chown -R itadmin:itadmin /srv/samba/share/ # Change itadmin to your desired user/group

Verify the permissions and ownership:
Bash

ls -la /srv/samba/share/
ls -la /srv/samba/

5. Create a Samba User

You need to add a Samba user and set a password. This user doesn't have to be a system user, but it's common practice to use an existing system user.
Bash

sudo smbpasswd -a itadmin

You'll be prompted to set a new password for the Samba user itadmin.
6. Restart Samba Service

After making changes to the configuration, restart the Samba service to apply them:
Bash

sudo service smbd start # Or sudo systemctl restart smbd.service

You can check the status of the Samba service to ensure it's running correctly:
Bash

sudo systemctl status smbd.service

7. Configure Firewall (UFW)

If you have UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) enabled, you need to allow Samba traffic:
Bash

sudo ufw status      # Check current UFW status
sudo ufw app list    # List available UFW applications
sudo ufw allow Samba # Allow Samba traffic
sudo ufw app list    # Verify Samba is now allowed
sudo ufw status      # Confirm UFW status

Accessing the Samba Share

From another operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, another Linux distribution), you can typically access the Samba share by Browse your network or by directly entering the network path.

On Windows:

Open File Explorer and in the address bar, type \\your_ubuntu_ip_address\share (replace your_ubuntu_ip_address with the actual IP address of your Ubuntu machine). You'll be prompted for the Samba username (itadmin in this example) and the password you set with smbpasswd.

On macOS:

In Finder, go to Go > Connect to Server... and enter smb://your_ubuntu_ip_address/share.

On Linux:

Most file managers (like Nautilus, Dolphin) can browse network shares. Look for "Other Locations" or "Network" and then "Windows Network" or "SMB/CIFS Shares." You can also connect directly: smb://your_ubuntu_ip_address/share.

Note on Crontab:

The crontab -l and crontab -e commands in your history are for scheduling tasks. They are not directly related to setting up Samba, but are useful for managing automated jobs on your system.

Mediator Between Two Operating Systems:

Samba acts as a mediator or bridge between different operating systems by implementing the Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. This protocol allows Windows, macOS, and other Linux machines to access files and printers shared by the Samba server, effectively enabling seamless file sharing across heterogeneous networks.
